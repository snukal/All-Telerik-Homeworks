Bitch, 'cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll

Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated

Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

[Chorus]
I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating
I woke up in the new Bugatti
I woke up in the new Bugatti
I woke up in the new Bugatti
I woke up in the new Bugatti
I woke up in the new Bugatti

OK, niggas be hatin' I'm rich as a bitch
100 K I spent that on my wrist
Two hundred thou I spent that on your bitch
Do me a model put that on my list
Oh there he go in that foreign again
Killin' the scene bring the coroner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke
Hit her and go, I won't call her again
Woke up early morning, crib as big as a college
Smoke me a pound of the loudest
Whippin' some shit with no mileage
Diamonds cost me a fortune
Them horses all in them Porsche's
You pussies can't handle, afford it
$4,200 my mortgage
Ballin' on niggas like Kobe
Fuck all you haters you bore me
Only the real get a piece of the plate
Reppin' my city I'm runnin' my state
Keep me a pistol then run with the K's
Niggas want beef then I visit ya place, Bang!

[Chorus]

Yeah, I'm at it again
There go that flow bringin' tragedy in
Copped me a chain your salary spent
Niggas is sweet, bring them cavities in
Countin' money, hourly trend
Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
Niggas is squares, cabin Benz
Neck full of Gold Olympian shit
Neimans, I'm blowin the check on the gear
Fall in some pussy then hop on the leer
Strapped with them choppers in back of the rear
Sak pase, them killers is here
Woke up early morning, mind is tellin' me money
Paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumour
Millionaire nigga no rumour
Livin' my life off of tuna
Want it with me, I deliver the beef
Real niggas only enjoyin' the feast
Pull up a seat, bon appetite
No Louboutin's when that red on your sneaks, Bang

[Chorus]

Photographs of dope boys (I see you)
Is all they taking, finger prints on the Rolls Royce
Is why they hatin' push a button on these broke boys
That's detonation, walk a road to riches bare feet
I watch mama struggle now she livin' care free
That's why I hustle for that half a key that's 12 G's
I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP
You gotta love me I got shooters out the D-League
Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet
Left in a puddle, finger prints is on a hundred mill
And what it is? Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood
We hella Trill
Yeah

[Chorus]
