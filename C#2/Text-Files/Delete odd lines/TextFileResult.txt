We the motherfuckin' best nigga (Mike Will Made It)
Its over, Future (yeah)
[Chorus]
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
You get money they started hating
I woke up in the new Bugatti
I woke up in the new Bugatti

100 K I spent that on my wrist
Do me a model put that on my list
Killin' the scene bring the coroner in
Hit her and go, I won't call her again
Smoke me a pound of the loudest
Diamonds cost me a fortune
You pussies can't handle, afford it
Ballin' on niggas like Kobe
Only the real get a piece of the plate
Keep me a pistol then run with the K's


There go that flow bringin' tragedy in
Niggas is sweet, bring them cavities in
Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
Neck full of Gold Olympian shit
Fall in some pussy then hop on the leer
Sak pase, them killers is here
Paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumour
Livin' my life off of tuna
Real niggas only enjoyin' the feast
No Louboutin's when that red on your sneaks, Bang
[Chorus]
Photographs of dope boys (I see you)
Is why they hatin' push a button on these broke boys
I watch mama struggle now she livin' care free
I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP
Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet
And what it is? Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood
Yeah
[Chorus]
